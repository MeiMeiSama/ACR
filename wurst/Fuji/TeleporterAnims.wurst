package TeleporterAnims

/*

So we want a function that will play, from what I see
animation stand for teleporters? yea ok so, to initialize in wurst, we do it this way, then we write our functionthere
now at init, this will call our function, in here, we want to play the animation for the doodads

btw, never edit war3map.j, now we place the doodads in the map, so idk what name or how to fetch them     the names i SS at discord chat

open world editor and go in here, do u have those triggers left? no i deleted the trigger, but i got the regions on the map, can u open world editor i will teach u something

there u go   
u only had these 4 right? yep 

Did you need to do anything else with triggers? no

Good tip is when u dont know how to do something, just try write in the code, it will bring up everything u can do, eg with doodad
its loading, java, need to wait a bit, see?

if you want to run a function after X time and not at initialization, you can do

*/

init
    teleporterAnimations()


function teleporterAnimations ()
    SetDoodadAnimationRect(gg_rct_TeleportBossesLeft, 'D029', "stand", false)
    SetDoodadAnimationRect(gg_rct_TeleportBossesRight, 'D029', "stand", false)
    SetDoodadAnimationRect(gg_rct_TeleportBossesBottom, 'D029', "stand", false)
    SetDoodadAnimationRect(gg_rct_TeleportBossesMain, 'D029', "stand", false)
