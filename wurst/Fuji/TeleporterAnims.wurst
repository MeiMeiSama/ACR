package TeleporterAnims

/*
So we want a function that will play Doodad animations. You know how initialization works, so simply call a function you want to use, and write your code in there.

In the function, for example now we want to play a certain Doodad (D029) animation.
In the function, simply write "Doodad", it's gonna bring up all API starting with Doodad (might take time if java has not loaded properly yet) 
When writing Doodad, it brought up an API called "SetDoodadAnimationRect". You can use this to set the animation for all doodads of type X in this region.
SetDoodadAnimationRect(theRegion, doodadType, animName, idkThisJustSetAsFalse)

So the following code:

SetDoodadAnimationRect(gg_rct_TeleportBossesLeft, 'D029', "stand", false)

Will set all Doodads of type D029 as "stand" in the region gg_rct_TeleportBossesLeft.

Remember, that you can also make triggers in GUI in the World Editor, and when you done what you want, convert it to JASS:
(Edit -> Convert to Custom Text)
You can use this converted JASS to use as inspiration and code it in Wurst, it is almost similar, same API.
